# PRODIGY_DS_05
This project presents a comprehensive Power BI dashboard built to analyze global traffic accident data. It identifies critical patterns and trends related to road conditions, weather factors, and time of day, while also highlighting accident hotspots and key contributing causes.
🔍 Key Objectives
Analyze accident frequency by weather and road conditions.

Visualize time-based patterns to identify high-risk hours.

Identify most common causes contributing to casualties.

Highlight accident hotspots using geographic mapping.

Compare accident distributions across various environmental factors.

📌 Key Features
📍 Map Visualization: Geographical distribution of casualties using Bing Maps to detect global hotspots.

🌧️ Weather Analysis: Donut and stacked bar charts analyzing accidents under different weather conditions (Rain, Snow, Fog, etc.).

🛣️ Road Condition Analysis: Stacked bar chart comparing accident counts across various road surfaces (Dry, Gravel, Wet, etc.) and weather.

⏰ Time of Day Analysis: Area chart showing accident distribution across 24 hours to identify peak times.

⚠️ Cause of Accidents: Bar chart depicting major causes like Drunk Driving, Speeding, Distraction, etc.

📌 KPI Cards: Total Casualties, Total Accidents, Mean Casualties per Incident, and Most Common Cause.

🚀 Tools Used
Power BI for data modeling and dashboard creation

DAX for custom calculations

Power Query for data transformation and cleaning

📈 Insights Derived
Drunk Driving is the most frequent cause of fatal accidents globally.

Accidents are slightly more common during early and late hours.

Adverse weather (e.g., Rain, Fog, Storm) significantly affects accident rates.

Roads under construction and wet roads are more accident-prone.

Specific global regions show higher clustering of severe accidents.

🧠 Future Improvements
Incorporate real-time traffic data or weather feeds.

Deploy alerts for high-risk zones using predictive modeling.

Build a web-based interactive version using Power BI embedded.
